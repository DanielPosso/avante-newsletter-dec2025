Quick dev preview for the `AvanteNewsletter` component

Requirements
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

Install and run

```bash
# from the newsletter folder
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser (Vite will print the exact URL).

Notes
- This uses the Tailwind CDN in `index.html` for quick visual parity; for production you should integrate Tailwind properly and build CSS.
- The project imports the existing `v2NewsletterArtifact.jsx` file in the repo root.
